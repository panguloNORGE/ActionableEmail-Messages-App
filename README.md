# ActionableEmail-Messages-App
Actionable email app that turns email contents into tasks in SFDC

To build this app the following configurations and code are needed. Steps:

1-In SFDC (setup) search for Email services and create a new email service. See screenshot in this GIT repository:new email service
(notice you will get an email destination address by default where emails have to be sent)


2-This email service will need an apex class in order to convert the contents of the email into tasks in SFDC. See code uploaded in this repository and screenshot STEP2


3- To test the result send an email to the destination address . see screenshot in this repository


4- Now the email contents are transformed into a task in SFDC. see screenshot in this repository
